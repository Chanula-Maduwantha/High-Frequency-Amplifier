# High-Frequency-Amplifier
This offers a comprehensive discussion concerning the design criteria of a high frequency amplifier, which is aimed at amplifying a sinusoidal wave in the frequency range of 20 kHz to 100 kHz from a speaker with an 8 â„¦ output impedance. Within the scope of the project guidelines, our design was restricted to using only transistors, with a minimum of three transistors to be used. The ultimate goal was to achieve a high power gain output without any distortion. To initiate our design process, we utilized the small signal model for transistors in our initial calculations. To further evaluate and simulate the circuit design, we employed LTspice XVII. Furthermore, the printed circuit board (PCB) was designed using Altium Designer(22.9.1). The physical circuit was implemented on a bread board before the PCB design process. Finally, the enclosure was designed using Solidworks2020. At the end of the project, a comprehensive data sheet comprising all relevant data was produced.
